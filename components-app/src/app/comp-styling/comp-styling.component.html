<h2>Component styling</h2>
<p>When Angular compiles your component, these styles are emitted with your component's JavaScript output. This means that component styles participate in the JavaScript module system. When you render an Angular component, the framework automatically includes its associated styles, even when lazy-loading a component.</p>
